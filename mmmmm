Certainly! Let's break down how Make processes the `Makefile` step-by-step to create `libft.a` from the initial `make` command.

We’ll start by analyzing the flow of targets, prerequisites, and how `Make` decides which rules to follow, especially focusing on how `%.o: %.c libft.h` gets invoked.

### Assumptions
- **`make` command**: When you simply type `make` without arguments, it will invoke the default target, which is usually the first target in the `Makefile` unless otherwise specified. In this case, it will default to `all`.

### Key Variables:
- **SRC**: Contains all the `.c` files in the `Makefile`.
- **OBJ**: Contains all the object files (`.o`), which are generated by compiling the `.c` files.

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial Call: `make`**
   - The `make` command starts by looking for the default target, which in this `Makefile` is the `all` target.

2. **Target: `all`**
   - The `all` target depends on the `libft.a` target.
   - So, Make now moves to the rule for `libft.a`.

   ```makefile
   all: ${NAME}
   ```

3. **Target: `libft.a`**
   - The target `libft.a` depends on the object files `$(OBJ)` (which are the `.o` files).
   - So Make now moves to the rule for `libft.a`:

   ```makefile
   ${NAME}: ${OBJ}
       ar rcs ${NAME} ${OBJ}
   ```

4. **Rule for `libft.a`:**
   - At this point, Make sees that to build `libft.a`, it needs the `.o` files (the object files).
   - This triggers the need to compile the `.c` files into `.o` files. Since `$(OBJ)` contains all the `.o` files corresponding to the `.c` files in `SRC`, Make will need to compile each `.c` file in `SRC` into a corresponding `.o` file.
   - For each `.c` file, Make needs to follow the rule for compiling it into `.o`.

   ### Here is where the pattern rule `%.o: %.c libft.h` comes into play:

   ```makefile
   %.o: %.c libft.h
       $(CC) -c $(FLAGS) $< -o $@
   ```

5. **Pattern Rule (`%.o: %.c libft.h`)**:
   - **Make** will try to apply this pattern rule for each file in `SRC`. Here's how:
   - For each `.c` file (for example, `ft_isalpha.c`), Make will try to match the rule `%.o: %.c libft.h`:
     - `%.o` will match `ft_isalpha.o`.
     - `%.c` will match `ft_isalpha.c`.
   - This rule tells Make to:
     - Compile the `ft_isalpha.c` file into `ft_isalpha.o` using the command `$(CC) -c $(FLAGS) ft_isalpha.c -o ft_isalpha.o`.
   - Make will do this for each `.c` file in the `SRC` list (such as `ft_isdigit.c`, `ft_strlen.c`, etc.).

6. **Compiling the `.c` files into `.o` files**:
   - For each `.c` file in `SRC`, Make runs the following command:
   
     ```bash
     $(CC) -c $(FLAGS) ft_isalpha.c -o ft_isalpha.o
     ```
     
     This command does the following:
     - `$(CC)` invokes the C compiler (likely `gcc` or `clang`).
     - `-c` tells the compiler to stop after generating the object file (do not link).
     - `$(FLAGS)` passes the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` to enable warnings and treat them as errors.
     - `$<` is the automatic variable that refers to the first prerequisite (in this case, `ft_isalpha.c`).
     - `$@` is the automatic variable that refers to the target (in this case, `ft_isalpha.o`).
   
   - This process repeats for all `.c` files in `SRC`.

7. **Creating the static library `libft.a`**:
   - Once all `.c` files are compiled into `.o` files (object files), Make returns to the rule for `libft.a`:
   
     ```makefile
     ${NAME}: ${OBJ}
         ar rcs ${NAME} ${OBJ}
     ```
   
   - The `ar rcs libft.a $(OBJ)` command is used to create the static library:
     - `ar` is the archive utility that creates and modifies archives (static libraries).
     - `rcs` are options:
       - `r`: Replace or add files to the archive.
       - `c`: Create the archive if it doesn’t already exist.
       - `s`: Create an index for the archive (this is optional but helps with optimization).
     - `libft.a` is the name of the library.
     - `${OBJ}` contains the list of object files (`.o`) that were just compiled.

8. **Final Static Library: `libft.a`**
   - The static library `libft.a` is now created and contains all the object files (`.o`) that were compiled from the `.c` files.

---

### Bonus Part (If you run `make bonus`):

If you run `make bonus`, Make will follow a similar process but will include the bonus files (`SRCBONUS`) in the static library.

1. **Target: `bonus`**:
   
   ```makefile
   bonus: ${OBJBONUS}
       ar rcs ${NAME} ${OBJBONUS}
   ```

2. **Rule for `libft.a` with Bonus Objects**:
   - Make will add the `.o` files from `SRCBONUS` to the existing static library `libft.a`.
   - It will first compile the bonus files into object files and then add those object files to `libft.a`.

---

### Summary of the Steps in Order:

1. **Run `make`** (which defaults to the `all` target):
   - `make` sees that the `all` target depends on `libft.a`, so it proceeds to build `libft.a`.

2. **Build `libft.a`**:
   - `libft.a` depends on the object files (`$(OBJ)`), so Make compiles all `.c` files in `SRC` into `.o` files using the `%.o: %.c libft.h` pattern rule.

3. **Pattern Rule: `%.o: %.c libft.h`**:
   - For each `.c` file in `SRC`, Make compiles it into a `.o` file (e.g., `ft_isalpha.c` -> `ft_isalpha.o`).

4. **Create the Static Library `libft.a`**:
   - After all `.c` files are compiled into `.o` files, Make uses `ar` to archive all the `.o` files into `libft.a`.

5. **Bonus (if `make bonus`)**:
   - If `make bonus` is run, Make will compile the bonus files from `SRCBONUS` and add them to the `libft.a` library.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The final static library `libft.a` contains both the standard and bonus functions.

By following these steps, Make successfully builds `libft.a` by compiling the `.c` files into `.o` files and then archiving them into a static library.
